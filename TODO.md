# EasyRoad — Backlog

Working notes on what's shipped, what's known-broken, and what's next.
Not user-facing; internal planning only.

## Known bugs (logged, not top priority right now)

- **Superelevation / curve algorithm inconsistency.** Reference screenshots
  from the `easyRoad 2` environment show a banked curve and an unbanked
  curve of otherwise-similar geometry looking inconsistent — banking
  doesn't appear to apply uniformly across equivalent curves. Needs
  investigation into `Geometry/Superelevation.lua` (`RollAt`, `SmoothRolls`)
  and how `Mesh/RoadBuilder.lua` samples roll per station — likely an issue
  in how curvature is sampled per-station vs. how the runoff taper
  interacts with short/long segments.
- **Narrowing (transition) lane algorithm still produces bad geometry.**
  Even after the "taper at the end of the segment" + z-fighting epsilon
  fixes, a tapering road can still show corrupted-looking shading on the
  transition zone. Needs a fresh look at `RoadBuilder.Build`'s
  `transitionAlpha` / adaptive station stepping interaction — possibly the
  taper zone's station density isn't fine enough, or strip mitering breaks
  down when component count differs across the taper.

## Next up — needs a decision

**Pie-menu / hover-based road editing (CS2-style interaction model).** The
user's actual vision, described in detail this round, is a bigger change
than an incremental UI tweak - it replaces "click a placed road, get a
panel" with a full contextual-menu interaction model:

- **Hover** an already-placed road (no tool active) shows a pie/radial
  menu with at least two actions: **"Open Road Builder"** (continue
  placing more of that exact road from its endpoint - see the snapping
  note below) and **"Edit Road Segment"** (a deeper editor for just that
  segment: lane reconfiguration, marking type per boundary
  double-white/single-white/dash/"stretch dash" - a marking style not
  implemented yet, bus stop placement). This is distinct from - and would
  likely replace or wrap - today's click-to-select `RoadEditSession`/
  `RoadInspector` flow.
- **Road Editor entry point** should itself open with a pie menu: "Edit
  existing road" (opens the library), "Create new road" (starts from an
  empty layout with zero components, not the current 4-component
  template), or "Place more of the existing road" (continues building the
  currently-open road elsewhere).
- **Numeric key shortcuts** (1/2/3/4 etc., or numpad) as a fast alternative
  to clicking dropdown/pie options for marking type selection.
- **Retractable side panels** - the Properties and Modules/Library cards
  should be collapsible to the side, not permanently docked open.
- A pie/radial menu is a real, nontrivial GUI widget to build well in
  Roblox (custom wedge geometry, per-wedge hover hit-testing, no built-in
  primitive for it) and hover-based detection on placed roads needs new
  always-on mouse-hover raycast logic distinct from the click-select
  approach `RoadEditSession` uses today. Given the size, this needs a
  design pass (how the pie menu coexists with the Road Tools/Editor/
  Settings top bar, whether "Edit Road Segment" replaces or extends
  `RoadInspector`) before implementation, rather than being built inline
  alongside everything else this round.

**Persistent segment endpoint memory - already partially true.** The user
asked that "the system remembers where a road segment ends/starts so we
can continue building at any time with precision." Every placed road
already stores its exact start/end position + tangent as attributes
(`RW_StartPos`/`RW_EndPos`/`RW_StartTan`/`RW_EndTan` - see
`RoadInstance.lua`), and starting a *new* placement within
`Settings.SnapRadiusStuds` of any existing road's endpoint already snaps to
it precisely and locks the tangent (`createRoadSession.lua`'s
`findEndpointSnap`). What's likely still missing is the pie-menu's "Place
more of the existing road" entry point specifically: clicking that action
on an already-selected road should start a build session pre-seeded at
that exact road's end with its exact profile loaded, without relying on
proximity/re-clicking near the endpoint. That's a small, well-scoped
addition once the pie-menu shell exists.

## Recently shipped

- **Bug-fix round: overflow, elevation, library placement, drag-and-drop.**
  - Fixed horizontal overflow in the Road Properties column: the dash
    length/gap row was packed too tightly for the fixed-width card and
    forced a horizontal scrollbar; split into two narrower rows
    (`ProfileFields.lua`). Road Tool panel's tool buttons now share row
    width evenly (`UIFlexItem`) instead of relying on auto-sized text width,
    removing the same risk there.
  - Elevation now has explicit up/down arrow buttons in the Road Tool
    panel (alongside R/F, which still works) - `createRoadSession.lua`
    exposes `AdjustElevation(delta)`, shared by both the keybinds and the
    new buttons.
  - The road picker moved out of the Road Properties card into its own
    "Created Roads" tab sharing the right-hand card with Modules
    (`RoadDesigner.PaletteOrLibraryCard`), matching CS2's AVAILABLE LANES /
    CREATED ROADS tab bar instead of living inside Properties.
  - Rewrote drag-and-drop to use `GuiService:GetGuiObjectsAtPosition` at
    drop time (walking ancestry for a named lane tile/strip) instead of
    comparing raw input coordinates against a cached `AbsolutePosition` +
    assumed tile width - the previous version had a real GuiInset/coordinate
    mismatch (ScreenGuis now also set `IgnoreGuiInset = true` so the drag
    ghost tracks the cursor precisely) and no longer depends on tile-size
    assumptions matching what's actually rendered.
  - Note: the logo image mentioned below was tried and reverted per
    follow-up feedback - the top bar is text-only again, styled in
    `BuilderSansMedium` and the brand orange.
- **Branding pass: brand orange + Builder Sans + logo.** Every button/
  checkbox/selected-state colour that used to be blue is now the easyRoad
  brand orange (#D98455, `Theme.ACCENT`/`SELECTED`/`ACCENT_HOVER`); UI text
  uses `Enum.Font.BuilderSans`/`BuilderSansBold` instead of SourceSans; the
  top bar shows the easyRoad logo (`rbxassetid://73102883268322`) next to
  the title.
- **Icon updates.** Bike (`117323310944439`) and Parking
  (`135215443300853`) module icons updated; new tool-mode icons for
  Straight/Curve/Freeform in the Road Tool panel (`80355330590276`/
  `90102359516465`/`112290052468250`). "Bus Bay" is removed from the
  Modules palette - see the Backlog entry below, it's moving to the future
  per-instance road panel as "Bus Lane" with a new icon.
- **Discoverable lane marking control.** The per-lane boundary control (in
  the lane strip's selected-tile row) is now a labeled dropdown - "Solid -
  no lane change", "Solid | Dash - right may merge left", etc. - instead of
  an unlabeled glyph-cycling button, so the existing per-lane marking-type
  feature (already fully implemented in `Mesh/Markings.lua`) is actually
  discoverable. Global dash length/gap remain in Road Properties.
- **Road Editor layout overhaul.** `RoadDesigner.Panel` now matches the
  CS2 / easyRoad 2 reference layout: Road Properties (left) and Modules
  (right) are two full-height columns, with the lane strip ("Road Layout")
  pinned along the very bottom spanning the full width underneath both -
  instead of three cards crammed into one row that forced the properties
  column to scroll. The road picker in both the Road Editor and the Road
  Tool panel is now a scrollable library list (name, click to select, "+
  New Road") instead of a dropdown.
- **Drag-and-drop module insertion.** Palette tiles in the Road Editor can
  now be dragged onto the lane strip to insert at the drop position (press
  and drag past a small threshold; a plain click still inserts after the
  selected lane, unchanged). Implemented as a small shared controller in
  `RoadDesigner.lua` using `useState`/`useRef`/`useEffect` + a global
  `UserInputService` listener while dragging is active.
- **Settings panel indent.** The docked settings sidebar no longer draws
  its own glass card/corner (it's already inside a bordered Studio dock
  widget); content is now inset ~5px further from the panel edges.
- **Top mode bar + separated surfaces (CS2 architecture).** A glass top
  bar (`UI/TopBar.lua`) toggled by the toolbar button switches between the
  plugin's three functions so nothing is crammed into one surface:
  - *Road Tools* — placement session with a compact CS2-style tool panel
    bottom-left (`UI/BuildBar.lua`: tool mode, road picker, widen-to,
    banking, elevation, hints, stop) — like the CS2 road tool box.
  - *Road Editor* — the full designer bottom bar (properties | lane strip
    | modules palette) for creating/editing road types, now with a road
    picker + New button directly in the properties card
    (`RoadDesigner.Panel` `Picker` prop). Tools/Editor are exclusive modes.
  - *Settings* — the grand settings (region profile, scale, banking,
    snapping, geometry) live in the docked Studio sidebar panel
    (`SettingsGui` renders straight into the DockWidgetPluginGui).
  `UI/EasyRoadGui.lua` and `UI/LaneEditor.lua` (the old page-routed dock
  UI) are deleted. Selecting a placed road still opens the designer bound
  to that road, independent of the top bar.
- **CS2-style build bar; old right-side panel removed.** The floating
  right-anchored panel is gone. While placing roads, the bottom bar now
  shows [Road Tool card | live lane strip | Modules palette]: tool modes,
  road picker, transition target, banking + design speed, elevation and
  hints on the left; the ACTIVE road's cross-section as editable tiles in
  the middle (session-only tweaks, kept via "Save as New Road..."); module
  insertion on the right. `UI/RoadDesigner.lua` was split into reusable
  `LaneStripCard` / `PaletteCard` / `Panel` so build, library editing, and
  placed-road editing all share one strip implementation
  (`UI/BuildBar.lua` composes the build variant). Layout fixes for small
  logical viewports (high-DPI screens): the bottom bar spans the full
  width, fixed card widths shrunk (240 / flex / 140), section headers
  truncate instead of bleeding across cards. Glyph fixes: dropdown chevron
  and boundary/move/remove button labels now use ASCII-safe characters
  (Studio's SourceSans renders ▾ and box-drawing glyphs as tofu boxes).
  The dock panel still carries the legacy page UI as a secondary surface
  (also the nav to Settings / road picker).
- **CS2-style road designer (`UI/RoadDesigner.lua`).** The road
  configuration UI is now a wide bottom-of-viewport HUD with three glass
  cards, modelled on the CS2 road builder / easyRoad 2 reference: a lane
  strip (one tile per component — module icon, direction arrow ↑/↓, width;
  click to select, then edit width/direction/boundary or reorder/remove), a
  Modules palette (Lane / Pavement / Median / Shoulder / Bike / Parking /
  Bus Bay tiles using the reference icon set; click to insert after the
  selection), and a Road Properties card (name, kerb lines, kerb offset,
  line colour, dash spacing, action buttons). The same designer serves
  both the library editor (Edit Roads → pick a road → designer opens with
  Save/Delete/Close) and the placed-road inspector (select a placed road →
  designer opens with Apply/Revert/Close). The old vertical list editor
  and left-side inspector panel are gone; `UI/LaneEditor.lua` is now just
  the picker page, `UI/RoadInspector.lua` the session-binding wrapper, and
  `UI/ProfileFields.lua` the shared kerb/colour/dash rows. Not yet done:
  true drag-and-drop (insertion is click-based), and the build HUD's
  "Adjust Widths" section hasn't been replaced by a strip yet.
- **Select a placed road → contextual edit panel.** Click any already-placed
  road in the viewport with Studio's ordinary selection tool (no need to
  activate easyRoad) and a left-anchored inspector HUD appears, editing that
  road's cross-section (kind/width/direction/boundary per component, with
  add/remove/reorder), kerb restriction, kerb line offset, marking colour,
  and dash spacing in place — "Apply to Road" rebuilds just that model as a
  single undo step. Placed roads now carry their full curve control points
  and serialized start/end profiles as attributes (`RW_CurveKind`/`RW_P0..P3`/
  `RW_ProfileStartJson`/`RW_ProfileEndJson` — see `RoadInstance.lua`), so a
  road with session-only tweaks (a widened lane, a swapped-in Bay) can be
  reopened and edited without needing the library profile it started from.
  Roads that transition between two profiles show a note and only expose the
  kerb/colour/dash rows (component-by-component editing across a transition
  is still Road Editor-only). Roads placed before this change lack the new
  attributes and show a "can't be edited in place" note in the inspector.
  New modules: `RoadInstance.lua`, `RoadEditSession.lua`,
  `UI/RoadInspector.lua`; `UI/ProfileFields.lua` factors the shared
  component/kerb/colour/dash rows out of `UI/LaneEditor.lua` so the road
  editor and the new inspector can't drift apart.
- Marking rule engine: full line vocabulary (solid/dashed/double/asymmetric
  merge), per-lane boundary rules, kerb restrictions (single/double
  yellow), region-forced marking colour, per-road dash spacing override.
- Kerb restriction lines now replace (not duplicate) the plain edge line at
  any roadway edge that meets a kerb — previously only worked for `Drive`
  lanes, so `Parking`/`Shoulder`/`Bay` never got a kerb line at all.
- **Bay** component kind (bus / taxi pull-in bay) — full kind support:
  region-configurable colour (`RegionStyle.BayColor`), material, icon
  fallback, generic editor support (it's just another entry in the kind
  dropdown, same as Parking/Shoulder).
- **Kerb line offset** choice per road: "Inset (default)" vs "Flush at
  edge" — exposed in the road editor next to Kerb lines / Line colour /
  Dash spacing.
- Live width tweaking in the build HUD ("Adjust Widths") with a
  session-only override and "Save as New Road..." to persist it.
- Viewport glass HUD, easyRoad branding (toolbar/icon/tooltip).

## Next up — needs a decision

**Junctions & intersections.** With placed roads now selectable and
editable, the next structurally biggest gap is that roads can only ever
meet end-to-end (chained placement or endpoint snap) — there's no way to
make two roads actually intersect mid-network, no corner fillets, no stop
lines, no roundabouts. This is a large, mostly-greenfield feature (junction
node data model, per-lane connection graph, re-deriving markings at the
junction) and probably deserves a design pass before code. Worth reusing
the inspector's rebuild-in-place convention (`RoadEditSession.Apply`) for
whatever rebuilds a junction node's roads after an edit, so the two
features share one pattern instead of two.

Smaller alternative that builds on the inspector instead of junctions:
dragging a placed road's endpoint, or a duplicate/delete action in the
inspector panel — both reuse the same Apply-in-place machinery just added.

## Backlog (not yet started)

- **Intersections & roundabouts.** Junction nodes where roads meet
  mid-network, corner fillets, stop lines. Turbo and concentric roundabout
  layouts (UK/HK). Biggest missing capability overall.
- **Lane connector (CS2-style).** Per-lane graph at junctions; drag
  connections between incoming/outgoing lanes; markings re-render from the
  connection graph.
- **Traffic Light API (mock).** Reserve an API surface for a future plugin
  to specify signal phases down to a per-lane basis. Shares the per-lane
  graph model with the lane connector — design together.
- **Crossings.** Zebra crossings and HK/UK-style uncontrolled cautionary
  crossings (zigzag give-way markings).
- **Tunnels / bridges standard.** Auto-generated barriers/parapets on
  elevated or sunken segments, pillars for bridges. Reference: the user's
  Commonwealth expressway assets in their Studio environment.
- **Deep settings: material/colour overrides.** Per-component-kind material
  and colour tweaks in the standalone settings page.
- **Units settings.** Speed in km/h / mph / studs-per-second; distance in
  km / mi / kilostuds. Currently everything is hardcoded metric internally.
- **Shoulder-optional highway presets.** Built-in highway profiles always
  include a shoulder; should be a toggle.
- **Snapping beyond endpoints.** Mid-segment snap, automatic junction
  creation when a new road crosses an existing one.
- **Bus Lane as a per-instance road-click option.** The old "Bus Bay"
  module is being retired from the general Modules palette on purpose -
  the user wants it (renamed "Bus Lane") to instead appear when clicking an
  already-placed road, alongside other per-instance options (kerb indent,
  etc.) in the future contextual click-road panel. Icon reserved:
  `Icons.BusLane` (`rbxassetid://86439959503324`). The `Bay` component kind
  itself still exists in `RoadProfile`/`RoadBuilder`/`RegionStyles` (only
  the palette tile was removed), so this is a UI-surfacing task, not a
  rebuild of the underlying feature.
- **Bus stop icon reserved, unused.** `Icons.BusStop`
  (`rbxassetid://97224093362859`) is stashed in `UI/Icons.lua` for a future
  bus-stop decoration/marking; nothing renders it yet.
- **Parallel mode.** CS2-style "place a mirrored road alongside an existing
  one, offset by N studs" workflow. Not started.
- **Per-point elevation - clarify with user.** The user asked for "define
  the position and elevation of point A, then point B, like CS2." As far
  as I can tell this already works mechanically:
  `createRoadSession.lua`'s `elevation` value is live and applied to
  whichever point is clicked next (press R/F to change height, then click -
  that click's point gets the height that was current at the moment of the
  click; earlier already-placed points keep whatever height they had when
  *they* were clicked), and since curve points are full `Vector3`s the
  resulting curve already ramps smoothly between differing point heights.
  If the ask was actually about something else - editing a point's height
  *after* it's placed without restarting the whole placement, or a visible
  ramp preview UI - that's not implemented and would need new work Flagged
  here rather than guessed at and possibly built wrong.
- **"ProductIon" (settings page ask, unclear).** The request included "in
  the settings page we just add ProductIon" with no further context - not
  acted on this round since I couldn't confidently tell what was meant.
  Please clarify and it'll go in next round.

## Housekeeping

- Extract exact dimensions/assets from the user's `easyRoad 2` Studio
  reference environment (roundabout exemplar, T-junction demo, expressway
  barriers, yellow box). This cloud session can't reach a local Studio
  instance — needs a local Claude Code session with the Roblox Studio MCP
  plugin installed, run from the user's PC.
- GitHub Actions workflow still fails at startup on this repo (unresolved
  billing/permissions issue) — `tools/build_rbxmx.py` is the working
  around-it build path; `dist/EasyRoad.rbxmx` is rebuilt and committed by
  hand each round.
- Stale branch `claude/roblox-road-plugin-diml46` in the `roblox-redupe`
  repo (the plugin's original, since-superseded home) — could be deleted.
- No LICENSE file in this repo yet.
